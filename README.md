# PhishDetect
## AI-powered Phishing Email Detector

A Streamlit application that uses the Groq API with Llama model (llama3-70b-8192) to detect phishing emails.

## Features and Functionality

- Email Classification: The tool primarily classifies the email into two category : Phishing and Legitimate.
- Detection Criteria: Classification is based on criteria such as Urgency or Pressure Tactics, Suspicious Links or Attachments, Request for Sensitive Information, Poor Grammar or Spelling, Threats or Consequences, etc.
- Confidence Scoring System: The user is also provided with a classification score, which is based on the value generated by the LLaMA model's internal scoring, using factors like weights based on severity and the combination and number of red flags.
- Deatiled Analysis: A detailed analysis is also generated by the LLaMA model based on the prompt structure identifying which of the factors are present/absent.
- Logging System: Python's logging library has been used to create a log system where entries include the following details: timestamp - level - message.
